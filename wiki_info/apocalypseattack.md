The Caro–Kann Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:



1. e4 c6

The Caro–Kann is a common defence against 1.e4. It is classified as a Semi-Open Game, like the Sicilian Defence and French Defence, although it is thought to be more solid and less dynamic than either of those openings. It often leads to good endgames for Black, who has the better pawn structure.

Black prepares to contest the centre with 2...d5. Unlike the similarly motivated French Defence, the Caro–Kann does not hinder the development of Black's light-squared bishop. It comes at the cost of a tempo, however, because Black has to play 1...c6 before pushing the pawn to c5, whereas Black can push c7–c5 in one move in the French Defence. White can combat the Caro–Kann in several different ways, often gaining a space advantage; additionally, Black has less mobility and can lag in development. 

The Caro–Kann remains a popular opening in top level chess, being employed by among others Alireza Firouzja, Vladislav Artemiev and Ding Liren.
